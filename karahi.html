    <h1>Karahi page</h1>
    <p>The base of the karhi is yoghurt and chickpea flour (besan) along with the spices. Blend onion, garlic, yoghurt, chickpea flour (besan) with spices and water into a smooth paste. Place this paste with water into a pot and bring it to a boil. Turn heat to low, and cook this mixture for around 1.5 hours on low simmer to cook and let the flavours develop.</p>
